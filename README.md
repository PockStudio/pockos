# Pock Device & PockOS
![PockOS Thumbnail](./img/Pro.png)

## Introduction

The **Pock Device** is a new class of portable hardware powered by **PockOS** (Personal Open Computing Kernel), your pocket OS, a terminal-first operating system designed from the ground up for performance, utility, and full user control. This is not a trend, not a gimmick, not a minimal smartphone, and not a repackaged AI assistant.

**Pock is not a phone. It's not a gaming console. It's not a retro clone.**  
It is a purpose-built tool — combining power, openness, and versatility — to redefine what a truly personal computing device can be.

## What Pock is Not

- Not a smartphone — There’s no bloat, no app store lock-in, and no need for distractions.
- Not a Flipper Zero clone — This is not just a hacking gadget. It's a full OS and computing environment.
- Not a dumb phone — It’s designed to be smart where it matters, giving you tools, not restrictions.
- Not an AI gadget — This is not a consumer assistant like the Rabbit R1 or Humane AI Pin. Pock is not trying to guess your needs. It lets *you* build, install, and control your environment.
- Not a trend — Pock is built to last, evolve, and empower serious users over time.

## What Pock Is

- A high-performance terminal-first computing device  
- An always-ready offline tool for developers, creators, tinkerers, and technologists
- A portable OS with full filesystem access, local app storage, and system-level configurability
- A personal assistant you control — from language translation to offline AI models and productivity tools
- A media player, game device, translator, and portable server, all in one rugged and compact design
- A software-first product, driven by the custom-built PockOS, not dependent on third-party services or walled ecosystems
- An open app store available for developers to build and distribute their own apps, fostering a community-driven ecosystem

## Indie Project Notice

Pock is an **indie hardware and software project**.  
This means:

- **Physical devices are limited** and built for people who truly want them — not for hype or popularity.
- If you're here to follow a trend or try the “next cool gadget,” this isn't for you.
- Pock is for people who *already know* they want something different.

## Try Before You Buy

For those who want to experience what PockOS is like, we provide the **PockOS Simulator**, available for both **iOS** and **Android**.

- Simulates basic PockOS features
- Great for testing your workflow or seeing if it fits your use-case
- Meant for trial only and also for app development and testing
- Meant for trial only — full features require the physical device

## Limitations and Design Constraints

The Pock Device does not feature a touchscreen. All interaction is done via a joystick and physical buttons. This is intentional.

- It is designed for **focus**, not consumption.
- It is **minimal by choice**, prioritizing control and durability over touch-driven UI complexity.
- It is **powerful**, but **unprivileged by default** — users gain root-level access when they choose, not when vendors allow it.

These constraints are not shortcomings — they define a **new category** of device: powerful, portable, personal, programmable, and distraction-free.

## PockOS Features

- Full terminal environment (Unix-like)
- App and game installation from trusted open sources
- File system navigation with local storage
- Configurable UI and runtime behavior
- Offline translator, media player, and scripting capabilities
- Wireless file sharing and device-to-device sync
- Custom shell and user profile system
- Support for JAR files, retro games, local AI apps, and more

---

## Target Users

- Developers who want a portable dev station without distractions
- Tinkerers and technologists who want full access to their device
- Privacy-conscious users who don’t want always-on, always-watching systems
- Creators and travelers who want a reliable tool for media, productivity, or translation on the go

## Philosophy

Pock is a platform for those who want to build, break, explore, and own their experience. We don’t believe in feeding users controlled environments, dependency on the cloud, or limited-purpose devices. We believe in tools that last, improve, and evolve — controlled by you, not by trends.
