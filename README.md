# Pock / PockOS

Pock is a platform currently under development by a single creator.  
It is designed to create a modern, unified environment for powering a wide range of devices â€” including smartphones, personal computers, gaming PCs, gaming consoles, and more.

PockOS is the secure operating system built using Pock. It focuses on enabling a single codebase to run consistently across all devices, including the web, while maintaining pixel-perfect precision.
