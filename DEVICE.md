# Pock Device Specifications

The Pock Device is a new kind of portable system — not a dumb phone, not a gaming handheld, and not just another smart device. It’s a focused, screen-free solution for those who want a powerful, distraction-free way to connect, create, and carry their digital life in their pocket.

It’s not built specifically for gaming or productivity — but it can handle both. With robust hardware, a tactile-first interface, and seamless wireless features, Pock is its own category.

This design freedom lets Pock deliver performance and durability beyond typical handhelds.
